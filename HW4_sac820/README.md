## Assignment 3
I did this assignment by myself. I don't think I had much trouble with
this one but I wish I understood the pros and cons of using a
chi square test better.  


## Assignment 4 
I did the vast bulk of this assignment by myself. The only help I had 
from outside was that Sam Ovenshine told me about the Astral library
for Python. However, I did not end up using that. I had some difficulty
getting my code to see if a point was within a polygon. I am very used
to R so in some ways I love Pandas dataframes. But I really don't like
these series inside of them. It's a bit annoying. I need to get to know
GeoPandas a lot better.
